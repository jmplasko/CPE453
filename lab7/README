Compile: make

Run: ./main addresses.txt

So the spec calls for a TLB but it doesn't 
make it faster in this instance since all 
the pages fit in memory. It would be useful 
if pages were being moved in and out. For this 
reason I left it out. If i wanted to add it I would
just copy and paste my set_and_check function with 
slight changes.
